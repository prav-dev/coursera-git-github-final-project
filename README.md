# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple interest calculator that computes the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## What is Simple Interest?

Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount  
- **R** = Rate of interest per year  
- **T** = Time period in years  

## How the Calculator Works

1. The user provides:
   - Principal amount
   - Rate of interest
   - Time period
2. The calculator applies the simple interest formula.
3. The calculated simple interest is displayed as output.

## Example

**Input:**
- Principal = 1000  
- Rate = 5  
- Time = 2  

**Calculation:**
SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

**Output:**
Simple Interest = 100
